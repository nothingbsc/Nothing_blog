On this blog I will be deatailing my journey, how I built Nothing Protocol, what lessons I have learned and what the plans are for the future. I believe devs and communities should have safe projects which they can invest in, without manipulation from devs and without losing out to bots, I believe by documenting this journey I can help influence the crypto community for the better.
