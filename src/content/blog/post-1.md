Nothing Protocol has been created to offer investors a safe crypto to invest in, the space is infested with scams and most investors lose money. It used to be much different, I will be documenting how Nothing Protocol works, what will do to build a long term project when most projects are dying in days and how we have prioritized security. 

I've been in Crypto for a number of years, held memecoins that hit the top 100 in marketcap, been a part of and managed teams of multimillion marketcap projects. Right now the space is infested with scams, pump and dumps and one day cryptocurrencies. 

## How I Got It Started

> The past can't hurt you anymore, not unless you let it.

Created a simple plan - there are always investors looking for launches but most lose out. Nothing protocol creates safe launches, with a small percentage of supply being airdropped to holders and a percentage of profits being used to buy back and burn nothing protocol. People will buy into these launches regardless of the market - so Nothing Protocol will always exist.

### Setup - Start With Security First

I installed the Ubuntu operating system on a spare computer, seperating wallets, passwords and all information about the project from my personal computer. Here is a [helpful guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop-1804#1-overview).  

Installed VSCode and helpful extensions such as: 

* [Tabnine](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode) - Auto Complete Code
* [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - Helps distingish code by color. 
* [ES7](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets) React ES7 Syntax.
* [Import Cost](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost) Shows the size of imports in your code.
* [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) ESLint rules to create better Typescript code.
* [Auto RenameTag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag) Auto Rename end tag when editing tags.
* [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) Spell check text and code.

I heard a lot about ChakraUI a front end framework for react,Front end frameworks are what allow Devs to create good looking websites fast. I used this video to help me build the web: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dSOsUNTxJE

After making some changes to UI and creating a logo using Canva(https://www.canva.com/) I was ready to go. I then created the telegram group, in order to setup the telegram group I added the logo, a friendly bot called [MissRoseBot](https://t.me/MissRose_bot) which helps investors by responding to questions from investors. I also added [SafeguardRobot](https://t.me/SafeguardRobot) to protect the group from bots.

I added [buybottech](https://t.me/buytech) so investors can see the value of buys and added the bot [skeletonpricebot](https://t.me/SkeletonPriceBot) so investors can see the price and chart.

Created a social media account on [twitter](https://twitter.com/nothingcoinbsc) to share updates on the project.

### The Token

In order to create the token I utilised a safe token contract here you can find the [code](https://github.com/nothingbsc/crypto_Contract). I deployed the Nothing contract including the website and twitter to attract investors and made sure to implement a few measures at launch to protect investors from bots and snipers. 

* I made clear in the Telegram group only to buy after I gave the go ahead.
* Increased the fee to 90% on buys and sells to ensure bots/snipers got an insignificant amount of supply.
* Updated the fees to 99% buy and sell to encourage bots to sell.
* Lowered the fee to 55% before lowering again to 25% and giving the go ahead for investors to buy. 
* After this I lowered fees, locked liquidity and renounced - which means I no longer have control of any functions.


### How do we Grow?

We stay consistent right now investors are used to Devs and teams over promising and under delivering we make sure to deliver and over time we will gain the trust of crypto users and grow.
